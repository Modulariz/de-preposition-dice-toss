# de-preposition-dice-toss

## Simple python terminal game to practice Deutsch two-way prepositions.

- Execute `run.py`
- It will output a subject, a preposition and an object
- Write a sentence in German using those three words
- It will output a direct translation, a translation of that translation (It's here where you'll generally be able to catch your grammar mistakes) and an English translation of the retranslated text, just for checking if the meanings changed after translating.

Maybe someday I will remake this in React, I don't know
